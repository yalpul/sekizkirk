## Installation

First install dependencies using:

`yarn install`

Then establish data files using:

`python scraper/sekizkirk.py --path ./data`, this creates `data` folder in the root directory.

**Note:** If you are going to exract data files into another folder, also change import statements in the `src/index.js` file.

Now you can run development server using:

`yarn dev`
